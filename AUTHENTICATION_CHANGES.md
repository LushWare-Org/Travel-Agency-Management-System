# Authentication for Booking Actions - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Users can now browse all pages (activities, hotels, tours) without login, but must authenticate when attempting to make bookings. After successful login, users are redirected back to continue their booking process.

## Changes Made

### 1. Re-enabled Authentication System
- **ProtectedRoute.jsx**: Re-enabled authentication checks (was previously disabled)
- **App.jsx**: Added ProtectedRoute wrapper to booking-related routes:
  - `/bookingRequest` (hotel bookings)
  - `/activities/:id/booking` (activity bookings)
  - `/settings`, `/bookings`, `/profile` (user-specific pages)
  - Admin routes now require admin role

### 2. Created Authentication Check Hook
- **hooks/useAuthCheck.js**: New hook that provides:
  - `requireAuth()`: General authentication check with redirect
  - `requireAuthForBooking()`: Specific booking authentication with booking data storage
  - `isAuthenticated`: Boolean authentication status
  - `user`: Current user data

### 3. Updated Booking Triggers
- **RoomProfile.jsx**: Hotel booking now checks auth before redirecting to booking page
- **activity-detail/BookingForm.jsx**: Activity booking now checks auth before proceeding
- **TourDetails.jsx**: Tour inquiry form now checks auth before opening

### 4. Enhanced Login Flow
- **Login.jsx**: 
  - Handles post-login redirects with booking data preservation
  - Shows contextual messages when user was attempting to book
  - Redirects to appropriate booking page after successful login
  - Displays booking intent information in the UI

### 5. Added Booking Data Preservation
When users attempt to book without authentication:
- **Hotel bookings**: Room details, dates, meal plans, market selection preserved
- **Activity bookings**: Activity ID, selected date, guest count preserved  
- **Tour inquiries**: Tour details, selected options preserved

### 6. Post-Login Redirect Logic
- **Hotel bookings**: Redirect to `/bookingRequest` with full booking data
- **Activity bookings**: Redirect to `/activities/:id/booking` with booking details
- **Tour inquiries**: Redirect to tour details page with auto-open inquiry form

## User Experience Flow

### Before (No Auth Required):
1. User browses activities/hotels/tours ✓
2. User tries to book → immediately goes to booking page ✓

### After (Auth Required for Booking):
1. User browses activities/hotels/tours ✓ (no change)
2. User tries to book → redirected to login with booking intent stored
3. User logs in → automatically redirected back to booking page with data preserved
4. User completes booking ✓

## Files Modified

### Core Authentication:
- `src/Components/ProtectedRoute.jsx`
- `src/hooks/useAuthCheck.js` (new)
- `src/context/AuthContext.jsx` (no changes needed)

### Pages Updated:
- `src/pages/RoomProfile.jsx`
- `src/pages/TourDetails.jsx`
- `src/Landing/Login.jsx`
- `src/App.jsx`

### Components Updated:

- `src/Components/LoginPrompt.jsx` (new, utility component)

## Key Features

1. **Seamless Experience**: Users can browse without interruption
2. **Smart Redirects**: After login, users return exactly where they left off
3. **Data Preservation**: All booking selections are maintained through the login flow
4. **Visual Feedback**: Login page shows why authentication is needed
5. **Flexible**: Works for all booking types (hotels, activities, tours)

3. **Try activity booking without login**: Redirect to login → after login, continue to booking page ✓
4. **Try tour inquiry without login**: Redirect to login → after login, auto-open inquiry form ✓
