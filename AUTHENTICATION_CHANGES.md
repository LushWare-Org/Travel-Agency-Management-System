# Authentication for Booking Actions - Implementation Summary

# Authentication for Booking Actions - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Users can browse all pages (activities, hotels, tours) without login. For activities specifically:
- **Inquiries**: Can be made without authentication 
- **Bookings**: Require authentication before proceeding

After successful login, users are redirected back to continue their booking process.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Activity Authentication Flow
- **activity-detail/BookingForm.jsx**: Only requires auth for bookings, not inquiries
- **App.jsx**: Removed ProtectedRoute from `/activities/:id/booking` to allow guest inquiries
- **ActivityBookingRequest.jsx**: Updated to handle both authenticated and guest requests

### 2. Server-Side Changes for Activity Inquiries
- **middleware/conditionalAuth.js**: New middleware that conditionally applies auth based on booking type
- **routes/activityBookingRoutes.js**: Uses conditional auth for POST requests
- **controllers/activityBookingController.js**: Updated to handle requests without authentication for inquiries
- **models/ActivityBooking.js**: Made user field optional for inquiries

### 3. Re-enabled Authentication System (for other bookings)
- **ProtectedRoute.jsx**: Re-enabled authentication checks (was previously disabled)
- **App.jsx**: Added ProtectedRoute wrapper to booking-related routes:
  - `/bookingRequest` (hotel bookings) - still requires auth
  - `/settings`, `/bookings`, `/profile` (user-specific pages)
  - Admin routes now require admin role

### 4. Created Authentication Check Hook
- **hooks/useAuthCheck.js**: New hook that provides:
  - `requireAuth()`: General authentication check with redirect
  - `requireAuthForBooking()`: Specific booking authentication with booking data storage
  - `isAuthenticated`: Boolean authentication status
  - `user`: Current user data

### 5. Updated Booking Triggers
- **RoomProfile.jsx**: Hotel booking now checks auth before redirecting to booking page
- **activity-detail/BookingForm.jsx**: Activity booking checks auth, but inquiry doesn't
- **TourDetails.jsx**: Tour inquiry form now checks auth before opening

### 6. Enhanced Login Flow
- **Login.jsx**: 
  - Handles post-login redirects with booking data preservation
  - Shows contextual messages when user was attempting to book
  - Redirects to appropriate booking page after successful login
  - Displays booking intent information in the UI

### 7. Added Booking Data Preservation
When users attempt to book without authentication:
- **Hotel bookings**: Room details, dates, meal plans, market selection preserved
- **Activity bookings**: Activity ID, selected date, guest count preserved  
- **Tour inquiries**: Tour details, selected options preserved

### 8. Post-Login Redirect Logic
- **Hotel bookings**: Redirect to `/bookingRequest` with full booking data
- **Activity bookings**: Redirect to `/activities/:id/booking` with booking details
- **Tour inquiries**: Redirect to tour details page with auto-open inquiry form

## User Experience Flow

### Current Flow:
1. User browses activities/hotels/tours ✓ (no auth required)
