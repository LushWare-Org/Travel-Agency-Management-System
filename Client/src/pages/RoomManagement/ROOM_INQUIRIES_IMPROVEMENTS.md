# Room Inquiries Table UI/UX Improvements

## Overview
The room inquiries table has been completely redesigned with the same user-friendly approach as the bookings table, eliminating horizontal scrolling and providing a much better user experience through a modern card-based layout and improved compact table view.

## Key Problems Solved

### 1. Horizontal Scrolling Issue
- **Problem**: Multiple columns (Guest Name, Contact, Hotel, Room, Check-in, Check-out, Guests, Status, Actions) caused horizontal scrolling
- **Solution**: Implemented responsive card-based layout that organizes information hierarchically

### 2. Contact Information Display
- **Problem**: Email and phone were stacked in a single cell, making it hard to read
- **Solution**: Better organized contact display with icons and proper spacing

### 3. Action Button Accessibility
- **Problem**: Action buttons were cramped and only showed for pending inquiries
- **Solution**: Prominent action buttons with clear visual feedback and status-aware display

## New Features

### 1. Enhanced Card Layout
- **Primary Info**: Guest name, email, hotel/room info always visible
- **Expandable Details**: Full contact info, stay dates, and guest count in organized sections
- **Status-Aware Actions**: Different action displays based on inquiry status

### 2. Improved Visual Hierarchy
- **Color-Coded Status**: Left border indicates inquiry status (warning=pending, success=confirmed, error=cancelled)
- **Smart Information Grouping**: Contact details, stay information, and actions in separate sections
- **Clear Status Indicators**: Prominent status chips with appropriate colors

### 3. Better Action Management
- **Pending Inquiries**: Quick action buttons in header + full action buttons in expanded view
- **Processed Inquiries**: Clear status display showing inquiry has been handled
- **Visual Feedback**: Colored action buttons with hover effects

### 4. Enhanced Empty State
- **Visual Icon**: Question mark icon for better visual context
- **Helpful Message**: Clear explanation of what will appear in this section
